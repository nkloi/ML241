****VEHICLE LICENSE PLATE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION USING YOLOV8****

**Introduction**
   The project "Vehicle License Plate Detection and Recognition Using YOLOv8" aims to develop an automated system to detect and read license plates from images or videos. The system leverages YOLOv8, an advanced deep learning architecture in image recognition.

**Objectives**
- Build a system to automatically detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images/videos.
- Improve the accuracy of license plate recognition.
- Integrate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for reading license plate content.

**Technologies Used**
- YOLOv8: A deep learning model for object detection in images.
- Python: The primary programming language for developing the system.
- OpenCV: A library for image processing.
- PyTorch: A framework for building deep learning models.
- Tesseract OCR: For recognizing characters on license plates.

**Features**
1. License Plate Detection:
   Identifies the region of the license plate in images/videos.
2. License Plate Content Recognition:
   Uses OCR to extract the content of the license plate.
3. Real-Time Video Processing:
   Continuously detects and recognizes license plates from video streams.
