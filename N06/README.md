## `Student Perfomance Prediction using Random Forest Regression`

  

### Overview

  

This repository contains the `random_forest.ipynb` file, which demonstrates the use of the Random Forest Regression algorithm to predict student academic performance based on factors contributing to their success.

  

### Prerequisites

  

To run this notebook, you need the following installed on your machine:

  

- Python 3.7 or later

- Jupyter Notebook

- Required Python libraries:

-  `scikit-learn`

-  `pandas`

-  `numpy`

-  `matplotlib`

-  `seaborn`

-  `scipy`

  

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash

pip  install  scikit-learn  pandas  numpy  matplotlib  seaborn  scipy

```

  

### Usage

  

1. Clone this repository or download the `random_forest.ipynb` file.

2. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook:

```bash

jupyter notebook random_forest.ipynb

```

3. Execute the code.

4. Modify the code as needed to use your own dataset or to experiment with different hyperparameters.

  

### Customization

  

-  **Dataset**: Replace the default dataset with your own CSV file by updating the file path in the data loading section.

-  **Hyperparameters**: Experiment with the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model (e.g., number of estimators, max depth) in the model building section.

-  **Evaluation Metrics**: Add or replace the evaluation metrics based on your specific requirements.

  

### Notes

  

- Ensure your dataset is clean and formatted correctly before loading it into the notebook.

- If you encounter issues with running the notebook, check the Python and library versions to ensure compatibility.
